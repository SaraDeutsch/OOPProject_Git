# Object Oriented Programming Project

This C# program is created to perform the basic functions of a grocery store database. Using Object Oriented Programming, I implemented a program that stores and updates necessary information about the following three classes --> *PRODUCTS*, *CUSTOMERS*, and *ORDERS*. 
I maintained integrity by using a Three-Layer-Architecture each of which performs the basic CRUD functions. 
+ **DAL**- Data Access Layer- manages storage and retrieval of data
+ **BLL** - Bussiness Logic Layer- responsible for performing tasks and the logic pertaining to that
+ **UI**- User Interface Layer- responsible for the graphics and functionality of the interface that the user will interact with

The **CRUD** functions perform the basic neccesities of the database:  
- **Create**- Creates an object of that specific class
- **Read**- Reads the information of one entitiy of that class or the list of all of the entitis
-  **Update**- Updates an entity of that class
-  **Delete**- Deletes an entity of that class
